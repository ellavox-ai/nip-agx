# @nostr-agx/cli

A command-line **NIP-AGX agent**. It holds a keypair, registers that key in an
agent index through the real proof-of-possession flow, and then *is* an agent —
connecting to relays, decrypting inbound messages, running capability handlers,
and replying.

Looking for agents to talk to? [Elladex](https://www.ellavox.ai/elladex) is a public NIP-AGX agent directory run by Ellavox AI.

Two modes:

- **Directory client** — drive the Agent Index over its HTTP API: register,
  publish, search, claim and verify domains, manage a team's peer allowlist.
- **External agent** — `agx serve`, built on [`@nostr-agx/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nostr-agx/core) and
  [`@nostr-agx/nostr`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nostr-agx/nostr). This is an agent nobody hosts for you.

```bash
agx identity new                       # → npub1…
agx relay                              # a local NIP-01 relay, no Docker
agx serve --allow npub1peer…           # be an agent
```

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @nostr-agx/cli
```

From source: `pnpm install && pnpm build` at the repository root, then run
`node dist/agx.js` from this package's directory.

## Two agents talking, with no server at all

The fastest way to see the whole protocol work. No database, no web app, nothing
but two keypairs and a relay.

```bash
# terminal 1
agx relay

# terminal 2
agx identity new --profile a
agx identity new --profile b
B=$(agx identity show --profile b --json | jq -r .npub)
A=$(agx identity show --profile a --json | jq -r .npub)

agx identity allow "$B" --profile a          # authorization is DEFAULT-DENY
agx serve --profile a                        # leave running

# terminal 3
agx request "$A" invoice.review --payload '{"amount":4200}' --profile b
agx send    "$A" "Please review invoice 1234." --profile b --subject "Invoice 1234"
agx serve   --profile b --once --no-reply     # collect the reply
```

Try it **without** the `agx identity allow` line first. The request times out and
the agent prints why:

```
DENY  task invoice.review from npub1w2unus8…xdns
      not on this profile's allowlist — no reply was sent.
      allow this peer:  agx identity allow npub1w2unus8…
```

That is the specified behaviour, not a rough edge. A registered handler is
reachable by any pubkey on an open relay, so NIP-AGX makes authorization
**default-deny**, and a denied request gets **no reply at all** — an error result
would confirm this identity and its capability set to an unauthenticated peer.
The request still falls through to the plain-message path, so nothing is lost
silently. `--allow-all` opts out explicitly.

---

## Plugging in a real runtime

`--handler` points `serve` at a module that default-exports capability
implementations. That is the whole integration surface — the library owns
identity, encryption, relay routing, the task lifecycle, correlation and
receipts; the runtime never sees a Nostr event.

```js
// paperclip-runtime.mjs
export default {
  "invoice.review": async (payload) => paperclip.run("invoice.review", payload),
};
```

```bash
agx serve --handler ./paperclip-runtime.mjs
#   capabilities  invoice.review, invoice.approve, agx.ping
```

Capabilities default to the module's keys, so the Agent Card advertises exactly
what the runtime can service. A worked example is in
[`examples/paperclip-runtime.mjs`](examples/paperclip-runtime.mjs).

**The error boundary is worth knowing before you demo it.** A thrown error
reaches the peer as a bare `handler failed`, with the real message logged only
locally — an internal error must not leak hostnames, table names or credentials
across a trust boundary. To send a message that is part of the contract
(`invoice not found`, `amount exceeds limit`), throw `AgxPublicError` from
`@nostr-agx/core`; that message is forwarded verbatim.

## Agent Cards

A card (kind `11337`) is how an agent advertises what it can do. It is
**unencrypted** and signed — anyone who can reach the relay can read it, which is
the point: a peer uses it to decide whether an agent can service a capability
before sending anything.

```bash
agx card <npub>            # read any agent's card
agx card <npub> --verify   # check its claimed NIP-05 against the domain itself
agx card <npub> --raw      # plus the raw signed event
```

### A card cannot certify itself

The obvious feature request is a `verified: true` field on the card. It would be
worse than useless. A card is signed by the agent's **own** key, so the signature
attests that *this key published the claim* — not that the claim is true. Anyone
can publish a card asserting any org, any domain, any badge.

What *is* checkable is the claimed NIP-05, because the authority is somebody
else: fetch `https://<domain>/.well-known/nostr.json?name=<name>` and see whether
the domain publishes **this** pubkey. `--verify` does exactly that, and the point
is that anyone can re-run it and get the same answer — no issuer to trust.

```
Domain verification (NIP-05)
  IMPOSTOR  fiatjaf.com publishes 3bf0c63fcb934634… for "_" — a DIFFERENT key
```

That is a real card, signed and valid, claiming a handle its domain does not
back. The signature checks out; the identity does not. Both facts are worth
showing side by side.

An index's "verified" badge is this same mechanism, not a new one: an agent whose
handle is on a domain that serves its key verifies against that domain.
The index stores the outcome (`verifiedPubkeyAt`) and withholds an unverified
handle from public projections — but the index is a *directory you query*, which
can assert things a self-signed card never can.

> Verification needs a **public HTTPS** host. The resolver blocks localhost and
> private addresses with no environment bypass, deliberately — that guard is the
> control. Locally `--verify` reports `UNVERIFIED`; for a real pass, expose the
> host with `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000` and claim that
> hostname as the domain.

**An external agent signs its own** — `agx serve --advertise` publishes it.

**A hosted agent's card is published by the platform hosting it**, from its listing, so it
can never advertise something the listing says must stay private.

## When something goes quiet

```bash
agx doctor
```

Checks, in order, with the exact fix for each: file permissions on your secret
key, identity, relay reachability (a real REQ/EOSE round trip, not just a socket
open), the index API, API key and organization binding, and whether your
listing is actually discoverable.

The three failures that produce no useful error on their own are an index that
is not running, a relay nobody is running, and a listing that is `listed` but
not `public` — `doctor` names all three.

## Commands

| | |
|---|---|
| `agx config show \| set \| use \| list` | profiles: API base, key, org, relays |
| `agx identity new \| show \| import \| export` | the agent's keypair |
| `agx identity allow \| deny <npub>` | who may invoke your capabilities |
| `agx identity sign <nonce>` | sign an index challenge; prints the signed event to paste into the index |
| `agx register --slug … --capability …` | proof of possession + create a listing (also `agx identity register`) |
| `agx listing create --team \| --pubkey` | create a listing of either kind |
| `agx listing list \| get \| publish \| delist \| delete` | listing lifecycle |
| `agx listing set-visibility \| set-policy` | visibility and first-contact auto-allow |
| `agx domain add \| list \| verify \| remove` | NIP-05 domains |
| `agx search "<query>"` | search the index |
| `agx peers list \| allowlist \| accept \| refuse \| block` | a team's trust decisions |
| `agx serve [--handler <file>]` | run as an agent; `--handler` binds a real runtime |
| `agx send <npub> "<msg>"` / `agx request <npub> <capability>` | talk to another agent |
| `agx relay` | a local NIP-01 relay |
| `agx doctor` | preflight |

`agx register` also advertises the profile's relays on the listing, so a peer
that finds the agent can reach it. `agx listing create --pubkey` does the same
only when the key is this profile's own; for any other proven key, pass the
relays it listens on with `--relay wss://…` (repeatable). Only public `wss://` relays are listable;
anything else in the profile (such as the default local dev relay) is skipped
with a warning. Set them with `agx config set relays wss://relay.example.com`.

### Registering from the browser instead

`agx register` does the whole proof-of-possession round trip over HTTP with an API
key. If you would rather drive it from an index's web submit page, the browser
has no private key and must never be given one — so the flow splits:

```bash
# The submit page shows you a nonce; sign it here and paste the output back.
agx identity sign <nonce>
```

The index consumes the challenge **before** it verifies the signature, so a
rejected proof burns the nonce. Every retry needs a fresh challenge.

`--profile <name>` is global; a second identity or a second organization is just
a second profile. Every setting also reads from `AGX_API_URL`, `AGX_API_KEY`,
`AGX_ORG`, `AGX_RELAY`, `AGX_PROFILE`, and `AGX_HOME` relocates `~/.agx`.

## Things the CLI will not pretend about

- **An external listing publishes no Agent Card.** The index never holds your
  key, so `agx listing publish` reports `cardPublished: false` and points you at
  `agx serve --advertise`, which signs your own card.
- **Only `public` + `listed` is discoverable.** Private and unlisted publish
  nothing and appear in no directory search. `publish` warns when it lists
  something nobody else can find.
- **De-listing is *requested*, not done.** It publishes a NIP-09 kind-5 deletion;
  relays are not obliged to honour it, so the CLI never claims the card was
  removed.
- **An unverified handle is withheld.** Public projections null it out on
  purpose, so a blank handle column is the rule working.
- **NIP-05 cannot verify against localhost.** The resolver requires a public
  HTTPS host and has no environment bypass, deliberately — the guard *is* the
  control. Use a tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`).

## Data on disk

`~/.agx` is `0700`, every file `0600`, and writes are atomic.

```
~/.agx/
  config.json                    profiles: API base, key, org, relays, peer allowlist
  profiles/<name>/identity.json  the secret key
  profiles/<name>/state.json     poll cursor + listing id
  profiles/<name>/seen.json      replay protection
```

`serve` persists its cursor and seen-event ids after every poll, so a restart
neither re-drains the inbox nor re-answers messages it already handled. One
`serve` per profile — it takes a lock, because the seen-store is single-writer.

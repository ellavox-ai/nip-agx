/**
 * Read an agent's published Agent Card (kind 11337) and relay list (kind 10002)
 * off the relays.
 *
 * The card is the discovery half of the protocol and is deliberately
 * UNENCRYPTED — anyone who can reach the relay can read what an agent advertises.
 * Showing it plainly is the point: it is how a peer decides whether an agent can
 * service a capability before sending anything.
 *
 * Note a card is a CLAIM, not proof. The `nip05` on it is self-asserted; only a
 * NIP-05 round trip that maps the handle back to this pubkey verifies it, which
 * is why an unverified handle is withheld from the index's public projection.
